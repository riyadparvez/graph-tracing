graph-tracing
=============

This tool traces different curves in a graph and outputs values of curves based on registered coordinates. You can export the data in CSV format
It uses simple noise elimination. Given a threshold this toll removes any pixel below this threshold making the image in binary two dimensional array. Then use connected component alogrithm to extract feature from images.
